Hi there!

This project is the result of almost a year of work on my A-Levels. It is my final project submission.

The project itself as you will see is a sentiment analyser. It comes with the ability to train a new model or test a model on a given piece of data, there is currently no functionality to test a model of a database of inputs but this could be added without too much hassle.

It is important to note that I have not been able to acheive a significant enough accuracy level to prove that the model works. Unfortunately it is too complicated and does not run fast enough locally on my laptop to train the model a meaningful amount.
If someone manages to achieve a high accuracy, please let me know!

To add a new model, add a new database file with the described name in the program to the project folder and hit test, be careful not to hit train as the code will wipe your database! I would reccomend making a copy of any databases used too.
